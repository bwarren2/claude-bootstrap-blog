lessonsLearned:
  whatWorked:
    - "D3 chart components worked well in isolation"
    - "WebSocket setup was clean and reusable"
  whatDidnt:
    - "Too much scope in the initial prompt"
    - "Context window filled up before the project was complete"
    - "Trying to build frontend and backend simultaneously"
    - "D3 + React integration is inherently complex — bad choice for AI-assisted rapid prototyping"
  whatIdDoDifferently:
    - "Start with a static mockup, then add real-time features incrementally"
    - "Pick either frontend or backend, not both, for a single session"
    - "Use a simpler charting library like Recharts instead of raw D3"
    - "Set a hard scope limit before starting"

## What Happened

This project was an exercise in over-ambition. I wanted a full real-time analytics dashboard — the kind of thing that takes a team weeks — built in a single Claude Code session.

## The Scope Problem

The initial prompt asked for:

- WebSocket server with simulated data streams
- React frontend with multiple chart types
- D3.js line charts, bar charts, and area charts
- Real-time data table with sorting and filtering
- Dashboard layout with responsive grid
- Theme support (light/dark)

That's easily 6 separate projects crammed into one prompt.

## Where It Went Wrong

### Context Window Exhaustion

By the time the basic WebSocket server and React boilerplate were in place, a significant chunk of context had been consumed. Adding D3 charts — which require careful DOM manipulation that conflicts with React's virtual DOM — pushed the conversation to its limits.

### Integration Complexity

Each piece worked in isolation. The WebSocket server streamed data correctly. Individual D3 charts rendered fine. But wiring them together with React state management, reconnection logic, and error handling created a combinatorial explosion of edge cases.

## What I Salvaged

The WebSocket setup and basic chart components are genuinely reusable. I've extracted them into separate files for future projects. The dashboard itself remains incomplete.

## The Lesson

**Ambition rating 5 projects need a fundamentally different approach.** You can't just throw a big prompt at Claude and expect a complex, multi-system application to emerge. These projects need:

1. Incremental building (one feature at a time)
2. Multiple sessions with clear handoff points
3. Strict scope limits per session
4. A willingness to simplify when things get complex
