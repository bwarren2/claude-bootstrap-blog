  whatWorked:
    - "Starting with a clear, simple feature set"
    - "Test-driven approach caught edge cases early"
    - "Decomposing into small commands made each piece easy to implement"
  whatDidnt:
    - "Initial JSON schema was too flat — needed nested priority groups"
  whatIdDoDifferently:
    - "Define the data model more carefully before starting"
    - "Add integration tests from the beginning, not just unit tests"

## Overview

A straightforward CLI tool for managing tasks from the terminal. Nothing fancy — just a well-structured Rust binary that does one thing well.

## Features

- **Add tasks** with title, description, and priority (high/medium/low)
- **List tasks** sorted by priority, with color-coded output
- **Complete/delete** tasks by ID
- **Fuzzy search** across all task fields
- **Persistent storage** in a local JSON file

## Implementation Notes

### Data Model

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
struct Task {
    id: u32,
    title: String,
    description: Option<String>,
    priority: Priority,
    completed: bool,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

The simplicity of the data model made this project ideal for a first Claude Code experiment. Each command maps cleanly to a CRUD operation.

### Fuzzy Search

Adding fuzzy search was the trickiest part. The `nucleo` crate provides fast fuzzy matching, but tuning the scoring threshold required several iterations with Claude.

## Takeaways

This was a good "warm up" project for working with Claude Code. The narrow scope meant I could focus on learning the workflow rather than wrestling with complex requirements. Key lesson: **simple specs produce the best results**.
