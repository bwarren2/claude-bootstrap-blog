lessonsLearned:
  whatWorked:
    - "Describing the desired end state to Claude produced a well-structured, sectioned script"
    - "The script included idempotent checks (e.g. skip Oh My Zsh if already installed) without being asked"
    - "Backing up .zshrc before overwriting was a nice safety touch Claude added on its own"
  whatDidnt:
    - "tldr was deprecated in Homebrew — Claude's training data was stale on this package"
    - "No macOS system preferences (Dock, Finder, keyboard) were included"
  whatIdDoDifferently:
    - "Ask for a dry-run mode to preview what would be installed"
    - "Add macOS defaults configuration for Dock size, Finder settings, key repeat"
    - "Use Claude Code instead of web chat — easier to iterate and test on the actual machine"

## The Project

New Mac Mini, blank slate. I needed a full dev environment — terminal, shell, CLI tools, git config — and didn't want to spend an afternoon manually installing things and copying dotfiles from old machines.

## The Approach

This was a **Claude.ai web chat** project, not Claude Code. I described what I wanted in a single message: a setup script that installs my preferred CLI tools via Homebrew, sets up a nice terminal with Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k, and configures git with delta for diffs.

Claude returned a complete, ready-to-run shell script. I saved it, `chmod +x`, and ran it.

## What the Script Does

The script is organized into 8 clearly labeled sections:

### 1. CLI Tools via Homebrew

```bash
brew install eza bat ripgrep fzf jq htop gh tldr tmux \
  zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting git-delta
```

Modern replacements for standard Unix tools: `eza` for `ls`, `bat` for `cat`, `ripgrep` for `grep`, `fzf` for fuzzy finding, `delta` for git diffs.

### 2. iTerm2 + Nerd Font

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

iTerm2 as the terminal, with MesloLGS Nerd Font for Powerlevel10k's icons.

### 3-4. Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k

Installs Oh My Zsh with `RUNZSH=no KEEP_ZSHRC=yes` to avoid interrupting the script, then clones Powerlevel10k into the custom themes directory. Both include checks to skip if already installed.

### 5. fzf Key Bindings

Sets up `Ctrl+T` (file search), `Ctrl+R` (history search), and `Alt+C` (cd into directory) bindings.

### 6. .zshrc Configuration

The biggest section — writes a complete `.zshrc` with:

- **Powerlevel10k** instant prompt at the top
- **Oh My Zsh** plugins: git, z, docker, history, jsontools
- **Homebrew zsh plugins**: autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- **fzf** integration with ripgrep as the default file finder
- **Aliases**: `ls` → `eza`, `cat` → `bat`, `grep` → `rg`, `top` → `htop`, plus git shortcuts

Backs up the existing `.zshrc` with a timestamp before overwriting.

### 7. .gitconfig

Configures git with delta as the pager, side-by-side diffs, line numbers, Dracula syntax theme, and useful aliases (`st`, `co`, `br`, `lg`, `unstage`, `last`).

### 8. Next Steps

Prints manual follow-up tasks: set the Nerd Font in iTerm2, run `p10k configure`, authenticate with `gh auth login`.

## How It Went

The script ran cleanly from start to finish. One issue: **`tldr` is deprecated in Homebrew** (replaced by `tlrc`). The install still succeeded with a warning, but it's a clear example of Claude's training data going stale on package names.

Everything else worked: 12 CLI tools, iTerm2, 60+ font files, Oh My Zsh, Powerlevel10k, fzf bindings, and both config files — all installed in a couple of minutes.

The remaining steps were manual by design: configuring the iTerm2 font, running the Powerlevel10k setup wizard (`p10k configure`), and authenticating with GitHub.

## Claude.ai vs Claude Code

This was done through Claude.ai's web interface, not Claude Code. The tradeoff:

- **Web chat was fine for this** — a single prompt produced a complete, working script. No iteration needed.
- **Claude Code would have been better for refinement** — if I'd wanted to add macOS defaults, tweak the aliases, or debug issues, being on the actual machine with file access would have been faster than copy-pasting between a browser and terminal.

For simple, well-defined automation tasks, web chat works. For anything iterative, Claude Code is the better tool.
