  - prompt: "Implement the following plan: [full project spec with phases, file lists, and build order]"
    context: "Initial project scaffold from a detailed plan document"
    effectiveness: high
    notes: "Providing the complete spec upfront let Claude scaffold the entire project in one session without back-and-forth."
  - prompt: "Use plan mode to design the content schema before implementing"
    context: "Content collection schema design"
    effectiveness: high
    notes: "Plan mode helped identify all the frontmatter fields needed across features before writing any code."

  whatWorked:
    - "Detailed upfront planning with explicit phases and file lists"
    - "Scaffold-then-fill approach — get structure right first, then content"
    - "Using Tailwind v4's @theme for design tokens kept styling consistent"
  whatDidnt:
    - "Initial prompt was too long — had to split into phases"
    - "Some component props needed adjustment after seeing real content"
  whatIdDoDifferently:
    - "Start with sample content earlier to validate the schema"
    - "Use more specific TypeScript types from the beginning"

## The Inception Problem

This blog is its own first post — a project documenting the process of building the tool that documents projects. It's turtles all the way down.

## Why Build a Blog for This?

I wanted a single place to track what works (and what doesn't) when building software with Claude Code. After several projects, patterns started emerging:

- Some prompting techniques consistently produce better results
- Cost varies wildly depending on approach
- Lessons learned in one project directly apply to the next

A blog felt like the right format — structured enough to be useful, flexible enough to capture the messy reality of AI-assisted development.

## Tech Stack Decisions

### Why Astro?

Static site generation is perfect for a blog. Astro's content collections give type-safe frontmatter, MDX support means I can embed interactive components, and the build output is just HTML + CSS + minimal JS.

### Why Tailwind v4?

Tailwind v4's `@theme` directive makes design tokens first-class. The `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin replaces the old PostCSS approach, and `@tailwindcss/typography` handles prose styling out of the box.

### Why MDX?

Plain markdown can't embed components like `<BeforeAfter>` blocks or interactive prompt snippets. MDX gives the flexibility to mix prose with custom components.

## The Build Process

The entire blog was built in a single Claude Code session following a phased plan:

1. **Scaffold** — Astro project with all integrations
2. **Schema** — Content collection with rich frontmatter
3. **Components** — ~25 Astro components for the UI
4. **Content** — Sample posts (including this one)
5. **Pages** — Home, timeline, stats, about, etc.
6. **Search** — Client-side Fuse.js filtering
7. **Deploy** — GitHub Actions to Pages

## What Made This Work

The key insight: **give Claude the complete specification upfront**. The plan document included:

- Every file that needed to be created
- The exact tech stack and versions
- Schema definitions with field types
- Component names and their purposes
- A build order that handled dependencies

This eliminated most back-and-forth and let Claude work through the implementation systematically.
