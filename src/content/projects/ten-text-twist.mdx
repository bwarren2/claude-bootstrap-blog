  whatWorked:
    - "The detailed plan-mode doc — covering phases, file structure, JSON formats, share format, and key decisions — let Claude execute the entire build without ambiguity"
    - "Running definition fetching in the background while building UI components kept progress moving on two fronts"
    - "Generating puzzles with --skip-fetch and partial definitions gave a testable app immediately rather than blocking on a 20-minute API crawl"
    - "Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect) in .svelte.js files made singleton game state clean and reactive without a store library"
  whatDidnt:
    - "The dictionary API fetch for 8000+ words at 150ms rate-limiting takes ~20 minutes — only got 550 words cached before stopping, causing word reuse across puzzles"
    - "Module-level $effect in .svelte.js files needed $effect.root() wrapping — not obvious from Svelte 5 docs"
    - "First a11y pass on modals missed the tabindex and keyboard handler requirements — had to fix warnings after the initial build"
  whatIdDoDifferently:
    - "Pre-cache the full definitions file and commit it, rather than relying on a runtime API crawl"
    - "Use the HTML <dialog> element for modals instead of custom overlay divs — avoids a11y issues entirely"
    - "Add a service worker for offline play since the whole game is static JSON"

## The Game

Ten Text Twist is a daily word game (think Wordle's format, Text Twist's mechanics). Each day, players get 10 sets of 6 scrambled letters. Unscramble them to find words. Some sets have multiple valid anagrams — find them all to "perfect" the set. Share your results via an emoji grid:

```

```

🟩 solved · 🟨 perfected (all anagrams) · 🟦 solved with hint · ⬛ missed

## The Build: 40 Minutes, 7 Phases

The entire app was built in a single Claude Code session lasting about 40 minutes. Here's how the time broke down:

### Phase 1: Project Setup (0:00–4:00)

Scaffolded a SvelteKit project with `npx sv create`, installed `@sveltejs/adapter-static`, configured the static adapter with GitHub Pages base path, set up prerendering, created `app.css` with a full dark/light theme system using CSS custom properties.

**4 minutes** to go from empty directory to a building, deployable static site skeleton.

### Phase 2: Puzzle Pipeline (10:00–14:00, background through 30:00)

Two Node.js scripts, no external dependencies:

- **`fetch-definitions.js`** — Queries the Free Dictionary API for each 6-letter word, caches results to JSON, handles rate limiting with 150ms delays and 429 backoff, saves progress every 50 words for resume.
- **`generate-puzzles.js`** — Downloads the 12dicts word list, parses 6-letter words (~8100), groups by sorted-letter signature into anagram families (~940 multi-word families), assembles 365 puzzles with a seeded PRNG (mulberry32) for deterministic output.

The definition fetch ran in the background while UI work continued. By the time it was stopped (~550 words cached), there were enough definitions for 365 puzzles with some word reuse.

### Phase 3: Game State (4:00–10:00)

The core of the app lives in four modules:

- **`game.svelte.js`** — Svelte 5 `$state` runes for puzzle data, current set, found words, hint tracking, input buffer, timer, and toast messages. Handles submission validation, auto-advance, set navigation, and localStorage persistence.
- **`settings.svelte.js`** — Theme (dark/light) and mode (timed/untimed) with auto-save.
- **`stats.svelte.js`** — Games played, win rate, streaks, score distribution, best time.
- **`persistence.js`** — Thin localStorage wrapper with a `ttt_` prefix.

Plus four utility modules: anagram validation, puzzle number calculation (days since epoch in UTC), timer formatting, and share text generation.

### Phase 4: UI Components (14:00–22:00)

15 Svelte components built in parallel batches:

**Game components:** `LetterTiles` (6 clickable tiles + shuffle), `InputArea` (6 slots with shake animation), `Keyboard` (on-screen keys showing only the 6 current letters), `SetIndicator` (10 color-coded numbered dots), `HintButton` (definition reveal), `Timer` (countdown), `FoundWords` (words found in current set), `Toast` (feedback messages).

**Chrome:** `Header` (title + icon buttons), `ModeSelect` (timed/untimed selection screen).

**Modals:** `ResultsModal` (emoji grid + answer reveal + share), `StatsModal` (stats + score distribution bar chart), `SettingsModal` (theme/mode toggles), `HelpModal` (rules + scoring legend).

**Orchestrator:** `Game.svelte` ties it all together — keyboard event handling, derived used-letter indices, submission flow, auto-advance on solve.

### Phase 5: Results & Sharing (18:00–22:00)

Built alongside Phase 4. The share flow uses `navigator.share()` with a `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` fallback. The results modal reveals all answers with definitions, color-coded by status.

### Phase 6: Polish (22:00–30:00)

Fixed a11y warnings (added `tabindex` and `onkeydown` to modal dialogs), wrapped module-level `$effect` with `$effect.root()`, fixed the page loader to use SvelteKit's `base` path, added a custom favicon, and generated the full 365-puzzle set.

### Phase 7: Deploy & Iterate (30:00–40:00)

Created the GitHub Actions workflow, initialized the repo, pushed to GitHub. Then three quick UX iterations based on playtesting:

1. **Larger "I'm Done" button** — Increased size, added red hover state to signal finality.
2. **Skip tip** — A contextual hint ("you can skip to the next word and come back any time") that appears after 25 seconds on a set or after finding any word.
3. **Permanent tip dismissal** — Once dismissed, the tip never returns for the rest of the game.

    generate-puzzles.js           # Word list → 365 puzzle files

    state/                        # Svelte 5 $state singletons
      game.svelte.js              # Core game logic

```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Pre-generated JSON** — Zero runtime API calls. Each puzzle is a static JSON file loaded by day number.
- **UTC puzzle numbering** — All players see the same puzzle on the same calendar day.
- **On-screen keyboard shows only 6 letters** — Prevents invalid input entirely.
- **Timer starts on first input** — Player controls when pressure begins.
- **Free set navigation** — No set is a blocker; skip and return at will.

## Cost

One session on Claude Opus 4.6. ~40 minutes wall clock.

The session produced 410 files: 40 source files (app code, components, state, utilities, scripts, config) and 366 puzzle/manifest JSONs. Total output was roughly 35K tokens of generated code and content against ~10K tokens of non-cache input, with the bulk of the cost in cache read/creation as the conversation context grew across 20 increments of work.

At ~$45 total, that's roughly $1.12 per minute — or about $3 per component, $0.12 per puzzle file, and one very playable word game.
