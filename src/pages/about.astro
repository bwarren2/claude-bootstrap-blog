      <p>
        This blog documents my experience building software projects with
        <a href="https://claude.ai/claude-code">Claude Code</a>, Anthropic's
        CLI for Claude. Each post captures a complete project — the good, the
        bad, and the lessons learned.
      </p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p>Each project post includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Status tracking</strong> — complete, in-progress, or abandoned (yes, some fail)</li>
        <li><strong>Prompt snippets</strong> — the actual prompts that worked (and didn't)</li>
        <li><strong>Cost tracking</strong> — token usage and dollar costs per project</li>
        <li><strong>Lessons learned</strong> — what worked, what didn't, what I'd do differently</li>
        <li><strong>Tech stack details</strong> — every tool, framework, and library used</li>
        <li><strong>Claude techniques</strong> — which Claude Code features and approaches were used</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Claude Code Is Used</h2>
      <p>
        Claude Code is an agentic coding assistant that runs in the terminal.
        Unlike chat-based AI tools, it can read files, write code, run commands,
        and iterate on implementations autonomously. I use it for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scaffolding new projects from detailed specifications</li>
        <li>Implementing features with test-driven development</li>
        <li>Reviewing code for bugs and security issues</li>
        <li>Refactoring and improving existing codebases</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Document This?</h2>
      <p>
        AI-assisted development is new, and best practices are still emerging.
        By documenting each project in detail — including failures — I'm building
        a reference for what actually works. The patterns that emerge across
        projects are more valuable than any single success story.
      </p>

      <h2>About This Blog</h2>
      <p>
        Built with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro 5</a>,
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS v4</a>, TypeScript, and MDX.
        Deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. The entire blog was built
        using Claude Code — making it the ultimate meta-project.
